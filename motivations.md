I am motivated by providing for my family, which includes a new baby boy,
now just one months old.  My sweet, smart, strong, brave 8 year old daughter,
whom I hope will forgive me for all this screen time when we live somewhere amazing.
And of course my amazing and beautiful wife, without whom I wouldn't be the person
I am today.  I am also motivated to stretch my brain to learn new things, be able to
communicate and collaborate with others, and eventually contribute to this amazing,
yet disjointed world we find ourselves in.
